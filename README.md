# Imperial-College-Angular-Test

Task:
Develop a frontend application using Angular (or any other framework you are comfortable with). It should consume a backend API Service. You can
use https://demo.minder.care/interview/task , which is a very simple API that returns a list of tasks, or you can develop your own if you prefer (it can be a mock).
